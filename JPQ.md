Here are some more Ian Malcolm Quotes from Jurassic Park:
> “Scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplishment. So they are focused on whether they can do something. They never stop to ask if they should do something.”

> "We haven't got the power to destroy the planet - or to save it. But we might have the power to save ourselves.”

> “Your doctor Wu does not even know the names of the things he is creating. He cannot be bothered with such details as what the thing is called, let alone what it is.”
