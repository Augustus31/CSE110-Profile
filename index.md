## Who I Am
Hi, my name is Sumukh Murthy, and I'm a second year CS major here at UCSD. I enjoy activities such as:
- **cycling**
- **badminton**
- **game design**
- **reading about history**

If the last one piques your interest, then I have some book recommendations! Here are my top five:
1. Endurance (Alfred Lansing)
2. Dancing in the Glory of Monsters (Jason Stearns)
3. The Thirty Years War (Peter Wilson)
4. Machete Season (Jean Hatzfeld)
5. The Spy and the Traitor (Ben Macintrye)

Right now, I'm in the process of reading a few more books. They are:
- [x] 1356 (Bernard Cornwell)
- [ ] Iron and Blood (Peter Wilson)
- [ ] They Can Live in the Desert but Nowhere Else (Ronald Suny)

When it comes to fiction, my favorite will always remain Jurassic Park. That book is chock-full of some very memorable quotes, like:
> Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.

## My Programming
This section is for what I've programmed. If you want to see my general interests, click [here](https://github.com/Augustus31/CSE110-Profile/blob/main/index.md#who-i-am).

Most of my projects so far have been games. I have a website where all of them are listed:

Some of my earlier code has minimal documentation and is basically spaghetti. Here's an example:
`placeBird(color2,((eTime - delay*5/4)*dps/1000 * 3/2),location + (eTime-delay*5/4)**2/(15*dps))`
I have no idea what this does, looking at it now.
